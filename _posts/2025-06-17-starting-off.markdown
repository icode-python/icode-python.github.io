People say internet is not as powerful as it used to be back in the day. 
i think they mean google - search systems, world wide web when referring to the internet. 
maybe it is true. maybe it is not. but that is the only internet we've got. so, who cares?! 
internet has been the main source of discovering new ideas since i got my personal computer 
two years ago.  

now, i wanna use it to share my ideas and symbolic stories like this: 
'everyone in that town never knew what environmentalism was. they used gas for running their machines, factories, farms and incubators. 
then someone learned about that word called "environment", and stopped using gas for better cause and future of humanity. others
followed him for the common good and better cause. facturies stopped and that town went bunckrupt. but our fellow environmentalists
kept persevering: never giving up as they were told on those youtube videos. they had to prove that they are right! so, they even stopped using
gas at their homes even. then winter came... everyone died and town became a gost town. i wish they could see how much great life and the future
of humanity became after them.'

just made it up now. could be better though. apart from meaningless stories, i write about books, 
engineering, music and art. so, yeah, i am starting off. engines are ready. game is on.
