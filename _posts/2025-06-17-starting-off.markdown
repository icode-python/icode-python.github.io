People say internet is not as powerful as it used to be back in the day. 
i think they mean google - search systems, (www) when referring to the internet. 
maybe it is true. maybe it is not. but that is the only internet we've got. so, who cares?! 
internet has been the main source of discovering new ideas since i got my personal computer 
two years ago.  

now, i wanna use it to share my ideas and stories. i also write about books, 
engineering, music and art. hopefully. so, yeah, i am starting off. engines are ready. game is on. get ready.
