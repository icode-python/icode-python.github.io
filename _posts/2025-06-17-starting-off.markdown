Hello, my name is Shohruh O'ralov, and this is my engineering portfolio website. 

I have been always passionate about engineering, building things with my hands. I also loved drawing things, designing things
as a kid. Later, I began working in construction with my brothers, my father and just random people in that sphere of construction
work, who later became my friends. I think in construction, we not only build houses by baking bricks, laying them out, and constructing roofs, but also did pretty much engineering as well. We used to make big shafts, mechanical jacks out of wood and metal, pulleys out of bicycle weels and chains. 

I also accompanied and helped workers for their work in exterior/interior design. So, art and creativity has also been part of my journey. I remember, later in life, I used to help my father in his garage, fixing trucks and cars. 

From these experiences, what I learned about myself is that I love observing technicians, laborers, machinists and learn about their work. In short, there is something in designing, creating stuff that attracts me. So, I want to be an engineer.  

Now, I am trying to be like those who I used to watch back in the days. I am trying to make my own things and share them with the world. Through this blog, I share my creations as much as I can. I do my projects through self-teaching in a remote town. So, that might limit me somehow. But I hope you enjoy them. Thanks.
